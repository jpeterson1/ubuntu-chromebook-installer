Usage
-----

**ATTENTION: This will wipe everything on your device**

**ATTENTION: This is still a pre-release, there could be bugs**

1. Enable [developer mode](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices) on your device
2. Download the latest pre-release of this installer and extract it to a removable media
3. Boot into ChromeOS, connect to a wireless network and log in as guest
4. Open a shell (CTRL + ALT + t) and type `shell`
5. From the shell go to the location of the script on the removable media `cd /media/removable/` and press **[TAB] [TAB]** on your keyboard to show and auto-complete your removable media path automatically
6. Run the script with the `list` parameter to list the supported device(s) `sudo bash main.sh list` or the `search` parameter to search in all devices profile(s) `sudo bash main.sh search DEVICE_PROFILE` (ex: sudo bash main.sh search acer)
7. Run the script with the appropriate manifest for your device `sudo bash main.sh DEVICE_PROFILE` (ex: sudo bash main.sh acer-c720)
8. On the first run you will be asked how much storage space you want to dedicate to Ubuntu
9. After the first run, your system will reboot to complete the initial formating, then you will need to re-run the script with the same parameters to complete the installation process
10. Follow the prompt to complete the installation
11. After the installation is completed and the Chromebook has rebooted, press CTRL+L to boot into Ubuntu
12. On first boot you will be asked to complete your system configuration (Language, Time zone, Computer name) and create a user account

On future kernel updates, the script (profiles/devices/acer-c720/scripts/trusty-patch.sh) can be run from the installer folder to update the patches with updated kernels.(to some degree)
